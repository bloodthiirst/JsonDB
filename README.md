# JsonDB
A simple DB using JSON for data storage/representation

- this is just my attempt of creating a DB system similar to regular SQL databases when it comes to using primary keys and foreign keys but storing the data as a JSON file
- this is pretty much a coding adventure , so nothing serious going on here yet but feel free to test it and check it out
- My goal with this is to integrate it into Unity3D and use it as a core componenet for state saving and data loading/reloading
